<h2>Detailed description</h2>

<h3>Control where a simulation is executed</h3>
Any simulation in HOOMD-blue can be run on a number of CPUs or a GPU.  To control which, 
set the \c --mode option on the script command line. Valid settings are \c cpu
and \c gpu.
\code
hoomd some_script.py --mode=cpu
\endcode
When \c --mode is set to \c gpu and no other options are specified, hoomd will
choose a GPU automatically. It will prioritize the GPU choice based on speed and
whether it is attached to a display. Unless you take steps to configure your system
(see below), then running a second instance of HOOMD-blue will place it on the same GPU 
as the first. HOOMD-blue will run correctly with more than one simulation on a GPU as 
long as there is enough memory, but the performance penalty is severe.

You can select the GPU on which to run using the \c --gpu command line option.
\code
hoomd some_script.py --gpu=1
\endcode
Note that specifying \c --gpu implies \c --mode=gpu. To find out which id
is assigned to each GPU in your system, download the CUDA SDK for your system
from http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html and run the \c deviceQuery sample.

If you run a script without any options
\code
hoomd some_script.py
\endcode
hoomd first checks if there are any GPUs in the system. If it finds one or more,
it makes the same automatic choice described previously. If none are found, it runs on the CPU.

<hr>
<h3>Automatic determination of the GPU on which to run</h3>
Free GPUs can be determined automatically. To utilize this
capability, the system administrator (root) must first use the \c nvidia-smi utility to enable 
the compute-exclusive mode on all GPUs in the system (for an example, see http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=96638&hl=nvidia-smi).
With this mode enabled, running hoomd with no options or with the \c --mode=gpu option will result in an automatic
choice of the first free GPU from the prioritized list.

Furthermore, the compute-exclusive mode <em>only allows a</em> \b single CUDA application to run on each GPU. If you have
4 compute-exclusive GPUs available in the system, executing a fifth instance of hoomd with "hoomd some_script.py"
will result in the error: ***Error! no CUDA-capable device is available.
<hr>

<h3>Minimizing the CPU usage of HOOMD-blue</h3>
When hoomd is running on a GPU, it still uses 100% of one CPU core by default. This CPU usage can be
decreased significantly by specifying the \c --minimize-cpu-usage command line option:
\code
hoomd some_script.py --minimize-cpu-usage
\endcode
Tests performed indicate that enabling this option incurs a 10% overall performance reduction, 
but the CPU usage of hoomd is reduced to only 10% of a single CPU core.

<hr>

<h3>Preventing HOOMD-blue from running on the display GPU</h3>

While running hoomd on the display GPU works just fine, it does moderately slow the simulation and causes the display 
to lag. If you wish to prevent hoomd from running on the display, add the \c --ignore-display-gpu command line:
\code
hoomd some_script.py --ignore-display-gpu
\endcode

<hr>

<h3>Controlling error checking on the GPU</h3>
Detailed error checking is off by default to enable the best performance. If you have trouble
that appears to be caused by the failure of a calculation to run on the GPU, you 
can run with GPU error checking enabled to check for any errors returned by the GPU.

To do this, run the script with the \c --gpu_error_checking command line option:
\code
hoomd some_script.py --gpu_error_checking
\endcode

<hr>

<h3>Controlling the number of CPU cores on which HOOMD-blue executes</h3>
HOOMD-blue runs in parallel on any number of local CPU cores using OpenMP. The number of CPU cores
used is determined by the OpenMP runtime, which usually defaults to all CPU cores in the system. Limit the number of 
CPU cores used by setting the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS before executing hoomd or by using the --ncpu
command line option.

<hr>

<h3>Control message output</h3>
Set the notice level to a high value to help debug where problems occur. Or set it to a low number to supress messages.
Set it to 0 to remove all notices (warnings and errors are still output).
\code
hoomd some_script.py --notice-level=10
\endcode

All messages (notices, warnings, and errors) can be redirected to a file. The file is overwritten.
\code
hoomd some_script.py --msg-file=messages.out
\endcode

<hr>

<h3>Control the MPI domain decomposition</h3>
When no MPI options are specified, HOOMD uses a minimum surface area selection of the domain decomposition strategy.
\code
mpirun -n 8 hoomd some_script.py
# 2x2x2 domain
\endcode


The linear option forces HOOMD-blue to use a 1D slab domain decomposition, which may be faster than a 3D decomposition when running jobs on a single node.
\code
mpirun -n 4 hoomd some_script.py --linear
# 1x1x4 domain
\endcode

You can also override the automatic choices completely.
\code
mpirun -n 4 hoomd some_script.py --nx=1 --ny=2 --nz=2
# 1x2x2 domain
\endcode

<hr>

<h3>User options</h3>

User defined options may be passed to a job script via --user and retrieved by calling option.get_user(). For example,
if hoomd is executed as
\code
hoomd some_script.py --gpu=2 --ignore-display-gpu --user="--N=5 --rho=0.5"
\endcode
then option.get_user() will return ['--N=5', '--rho=0.5'], which is a format suitable for processing by standard
tools such as optparse.

<hr>

You can always run
\code
hoomd some_script.py --help
\endcode
to get a full list of the available command line options some of which
may not be listed here.
