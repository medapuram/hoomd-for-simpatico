\section sec_hoomd_vmd_plugin Reading and converting HOOMD-blue XML files with VMD

As of version 1.8.7 the VMD molecular visualization software supports the HOOMD-blue XML format natively with read
and write support through its molfile plugin library and can be used to build systems and convert between
MD and visualization codes as well. Here are some examples using this:

\subsection sec_hoomd_vmd_structure Read a HOOMD-blue XML file into a VMD molecule

Load the structure \c file.xml into VMD, then add the trajectory frames in \c dump.dcd.
\code
  mol new file.xml type hoomd waitfor all
  mol addfile dump.dcd type dcd wairfor all
\endcode


\subsection sec_hoomd_vmd_input Converting from a HOOMD-blue XML file to a LAMMPS input file

Load \c file.xml into VMD, then use topotools write out \c file.data in the LAMMPS molecular format
\code
  package require topotools 1.0
  mol new file.xml type hoomd waitfor all
  topo writelammpsdata file.data molecular
\endcode

\subsection sec_hoomd_vmd_data Converting from a series of HOOMD XML files to a LAMMPS dump file

Load a trajectory \c file*.xml into VMD, one frame at a time.
Then use topotools write out \c file.dump in the LAMMPS dump format
\code
  set first 1
  foreach f [glob file*.xml] {
     if {$first} { 
         mol new $f type hoomd waitfor all
         set first 0
     } else {
         mol addfile $f type hoomd waitfor all
     }
  }
  animate write lammpstrj file.dump waitfor all
\endcode

This conversion can also be done into all other formats that have write support in VMD, e.g. psf, pdb, dcd.
Since pymol also uses the VMD molfile library, it eventually will also have native support for HOOMD-blue XML files added.

\subsection sec_hoomd_vmd_inverse Converting from a LAMMPS input file to HOOMD-blue XML

Load the LAMMPS input file \c file.data into VMD, then use topotools write out \c file.xml in the HOOMD-blue XML format.
\code
  package require topotools 1.0
  topo readlammpsdata file.data molecular
  animate write hoomd file.xml waitfor all
\endcode
