 - \b GPU: (optional) A <a href=" http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html">CUDA capable GPU</a> is required to run hoomd with
    GPU acceleration. Without one, hoomd will run on the CPU.
 -  GPU \b Driver software (install only on systems with NVIDIA GPUs -- needed to enable GPUs for use with hoomd):
   - Linux - NVIDIA Drivers version 304.54 or newer (http://www.nvidia.com)
   - Mac OS X NVIDIA CUDA Drivers version 5.0 or newer ( http://www.nvidia.com/object/mac-driver-archive.html )

     
VMD 1.9 or newer (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) is not a requirement to run HOOMD-blue, but you may find it
extremely useful in visualizing simulation results. VMD 1.9 includes native support for reading HOOMD-blue XML files.

 information.

The standard benchmark scripts serve as a good test of your installation. To run one of them, open a
terminal and run:
\code
 cd /usr/share/hoomd/benchmarks
 hoomd lj_liquid_bmark.hoomd
 # ... watch the simulation run ...
\endcode

\section sec_gpu_options Supported GPUs

A GPU is needed to take full advantage of hoomd's performance capabilities. 
See http://codeblue.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/benchmarks.html for representative performance numbers.

There are a number of ways to configure a computer system with GPUs.

<h2>Workstation solutions</h2>

<h3>Upgrade an existing desktop system</h3>
If a desktop computer meets the necessary system requirements, a GPU can be added to it. Neither this document nor the
hoomd developers can determine if your system meets those requirements. Consult an IT professional for advice, if
needed. The manufacturer's product page should list the requirements for a particular GPU. One word of caution:
pre-built systems from many vendors are often engineered with very little extra space or power, and fast GPUs which are
both large and power-hungry will either not fit or fail to operate. A self-powered 
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product-quadroplex-7000-us.html">Quadro Plex 7000</a> might be an option
for a desktop with such limitations, but it may also be less expensive to simply buy a new desktop equipped with GeForce
GPUs.

For GPU-ready desktops, HOOMD-blue supports many GPUs. NVIDIA GeForce cards are consumer level GPUs designed for gaming.

HOOMD supports the following GPUS:
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product-geforce-gtx-680-us.html">GeForce GTX 680</a> - \b Recommended for performance desktops
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product-geforce-gtx-580-us.html">GeForce GTX 580</a>
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product-geforce-gtx-460-us.html">GeForce GTX 460</a> - \b Recommended for low power / quiet desktops
- And all GeForce GPUs with compute capability greater than or equal to 1.3 (<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus">see NVIDIA's list of GPUs</a>)
- \b Note: Factory over-clocked models are \b not supported.

Tesla CXXXX GPUs are professional level compute cards with more memory than their consumer-level counterparts.
Also, Tesla C20X0 cards are capable of four times more double precision FLOPS than GTX 480.
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/personal-supercomputing.html">Tesla C2075</a>
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/personal-supercomputing.html">Tesla C2050</a> - \b Recommended
- And all Tesla Workstation GPUs with compute capability greater than or equal to 1.3 (<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus">see NVIDIA's list of GPUs</a>)

Quadro GPUs are professional level graphics workstation cards.
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/quadro-k5000.html">Quadro K5000</a> - \b Recommended
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product-quadro-6000-us.html">Quadro 6000</a>
- And all Quadro GPUs with compute capability greater than or equal to 1.3 (<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus">see NVIDIA's list of GPUs</a>)

<h3>Purchase a new workstation</h3>
Pre-built workstations can be purchased from a number of vendors with any of the above GeForce and Quadro GPUs. 
Do check out vendors that offer custom gaming rigs. Some offer high performance configurations with up to 3 GPUs.

A limited set of vendors sells workstations with Tesla GPUs pre-installed: see http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla_wtb.html

A custom-built workstation is also an option for \em expert system builders and IT professionals.
NVIDIA has published a set of recommendations as a starting point: http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla_build_your_own.html

<h2>Data center installations</h2>

Data centers demand rack mount hardware. There are several GPU computing systems supported by HOOMD. These are 1U
rack mount enclosures containing 4 GPUs, a power supply and cooling fans. Two PCIe interface cards connect the GPU computing
system to one or two host nodes.
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product-tesla-S2050-us.html">Tesla S2050</a> - *No longer available*
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/product_tesla_s1070_us.html">Tesla S1070</a>

A number of rack mount enclosures and host nodes also accept Tesla MXXX cards.
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-servers.html">Tesla K10</a> - \b Recommended
- <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-servers.html">Tesla M2090</a> - \b Recommended
- And all Tesla Data Center GPUs with compute capability greater than or equal to 1.3 (<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus">see NVIDIA's list of GPUs</a>)

See http://www.nvidia.com/object/preconfigured_clusters.html for even more data center options.

<h2>Laptops</h2>

There are many mobile GPUs capable of running hoomd. Due to power, heat, and stability concerns, the hoomd developers
do not support laptops as a platform for long running hoomd simulations.

<h2>Future GPUs</h2>
GPUs newer than this document may also be supported. HOOMD-blue 0.11.x is tested and supported on the Kepler (GK110) 
Fermi (GF100) and Tesla (G200) generations. All GPUs from these generations are supported.
