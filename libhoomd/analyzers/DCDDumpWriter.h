//! Analyzer for writing out DCD dump files
/*! DCDDumpWriter writes out the current position of all particles to a DCD file
    every time analyze() is called. Use it to create a DCD trajectory for loading
    into VMD.

    On the first call to analyze() \a fname is created with a dcd header. If the file already exists,
    it is overwritten.

    Due to a limitation in the DCD format, the time step period between calls to
    analyze() \b must be specified up front. If analyze() detects that this period is
    not being maintained, it will print a warning but continue.
