//! Analyzer for writing out HOOMD  dump files
/*! HOOMDBinaryDumpWriter can be used to write out xml files containing various levels of information
    of the current time step of the simulation. At a minimum, the current time step and box
    dimensions are output. Optionally, particle positions, velocities and types can be included
    in the file.

    Usage:<br>
    Construct a HOOMDBinaryDumpWriter, attaching it to a ParticleData and specifying a base file name.
    Call analyze(timestep) to output a dump file with the state of the current time step
    of the simulation. It will create base_file.timestep.xml where timestep is a 0-padded
    10 digit number. The 0 padding is so files sorted "alphabetically" will be read in
    numberical order.

    To include positions, velocities and types, see: setOutputPosition() setOutputVelocity()
    and setOutputType(). Similarly, walls and bonds can be included with setOutputWall() and
    setOutputBond().

    Future versions will include the ability to dump forces on each particle to the file also.

    For information on the structure of the xml file format: see \ref page_dev_info
    Although, HOOMD's  user guide probably has a more up to date documentation on the format.
