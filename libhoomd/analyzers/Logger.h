//! Logs registered quantities to a delimited file
/*! \note design notes: Computes and Updaters have getProvidedLogQuantities and getLogValue. The first lists
    all quantities that the compute/updater provides (a list of strings). And getLogValue takes a string
    as an argument and returns a scalar.

    Logger will open and overwrite its log file on construction. Any number of computes and updaters
    can be registered with the Logger. It will track which quantities are provided. If any particular
    quantity is registered twice, a warning is printed and the most recent registered source will take
    effect. setLoggedQuantities will specify a list of quantities to log. When it is called, a header
    is written to the file. Every call to analyze() will result in the computes for the logged quantities
    being called and getLogValue called for each value to produce a line in the file. If a logged quantity
    is not registered, a 0 is printed to the file and a warning to stdout.

    The removeAll method can be used to clear all registered computes and updaters. hoomd_script will
    removeAll() and re-register all active computes and updaters before every run()
