//! Prints a log of the mean-squared displacement calculated over particles in the simulation
/*! On construction, MSDAnalyzer opens the given file name for writing. The file will optionally be overwritten
    or appended to. If the file is appended to, the added columns are assumed to be provided in the same order
    as with the initial generation of the file. It also records the initial positions of all particles in the
    simulation. Each time analyze() is called, the mean-squared displacement is calculated and written out to the file.

    The mean squared displacement (MSD) is calculated as:
    \f[ \langle |\vec{r} - \vec{r}_0|^2 \rangle \f]

    Multiple MSD columns may be desired in a single simulation run. Rather than requiring the user to specify
    many analyze.msd commands each with a separate file, a single class instance is designed to be capable of outputting
    many columns. The particles over which the MSD is calculated for each column are specified with a ParticleGroup.

    To allow for the continuation of msd data when a job is restarted from a file, MSDAnalyzer can assign the reference
    state r_0 from a given xml file.
