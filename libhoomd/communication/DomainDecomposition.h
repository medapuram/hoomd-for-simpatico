//! Class that initializes and holds information about the domain decomposition

//! Class that initializes every processor using spatial domain-decomposition
/*! This class is used to divide the global simulation box into sub-domains and to assign a box to every processor.
 *
 *  <b>Implementation details</b>
 *
 *  To achieve an optimal domain decomposition (i.e. minimal communication costs), the global domain is sub-divided
 *  such as to minimize surface area between domains, while utilizing all processors in the MPI communicator.
 *
 *  The initialization of the domain decomposition scheme is performed in the constructor.
