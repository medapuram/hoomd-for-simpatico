//! Computes the potential and force on bonds based on values given in a table
/*! \b Overview
    Bond potentials and forces are evaluated for all bonded particle pairs in the system.
    Both the potentials and forces are provided the tables V(r) and F(r) at discreet \a r values between \a rmin and
    \a rmax. Evaluations are performed by simple linear interpolation, thus why F(r) must be explicitly specified to
    avoid large errors resulting from the numerical derivative. Note that F(r) should store - dV/dr.

    \b Table memory layout

    V(r) and F(r) are specified for each bond type.

    Three parameters need to be stored for each bond potential: rmin, rmax, and dr, the minimum r, maximum r, and spacing
    between r values in the table respectively. For simple access on the GPU, these will be stored in a float4 where
    x is rmin, y is rmax, and z is dr.

    V(0) is the value of V at r=rmin. V(i) is the value of V at r=rmin + dr * i where i is chosen such that r >= rmin
    and r <= rmax. V(r) for r < rmin and > rmax is 0. The same goes for F. Thus V and F are defined between the region
    [rmin,rmax], inclusive.

    For ease of storing the data, all tables must be of the same number of points for all bonds.

    \b Interpolation
    Values are interpolated linearly between two points straddling the given r. For a given r, the first point needed, i
    can be calculated via i = floorf((r - rmin) / dr). The fraction between ri and ri+1 can be calculated via
    f = (r - rmin) / dr - float(i). And the linear interpolation can then be performed via V(r) ~= Vi + f * (Vi+1 - Vi)
