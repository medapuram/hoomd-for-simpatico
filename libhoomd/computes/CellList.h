//! Computes a cell list from the particles in the system
/*! \b Overview:
    Cell lists are useful data structures when working with locality queries on particles. The most notable useage of
    cell lists in HOOMD is as an auxilliary data structure used when building the neighbor list. The data layout design
    decisions for CellList were made to optimize the performance of the neighbor list build as deteremined by
    microbenchmarking. However, CellList is written as generally as possible so that it can be used throughout the code
    in other locations where a cell list is needed.
    
    A cell list defines a set of cuboid cells that completely covers the simulation box. A single nominal width is given
    which is then rounded up to fit an integral number of cells across each dimension. A given particle belongs in one
    and only one cell, the one that contains the particle's x,y,z position.
    
    <b>Data storage:</b>
    
    All data is stored in GPUArrays for access on the host and device.
    
     - The \c cell_size array lists the number of members in each cell.
     - The \c xyzf array contains Scalar4 elements each of which holds the x,y,z coordinates of the particle and a flag.
       That flag can optionally be the particle index, its charge, or its type.
     - The \c tdb array contains Scalar4 elements each of which holds the type, diameter, and body of the particle.
       It is only computed is requested to reduce the computation time when it is not needed.
     - The \c orientation array contains Scalar4 elements listing the orientation of each particle.
       It is only computed is requested to reduce the computation time when it is not needed.
     - The \c idx array contains unsigned int elements listing the index of each particle. It is useful when xyzf is 
       set to hold type. It is only computed is requested to reduce the computation time when it is not needed.
     - The cell_adj array lists indices of adjacent cells. A specified radius (3,5,7,...) of cells is included in the
       list.
    
    A given cell cuboid with x,y,z indices of i,j,k has a unique cell index. This index can be obtained from the Index3D
    object returned by getCellIndexer()
    \code
    Index3D cell_indexer = cl->getCellIndexer();
    cidx = cell_indexer(i,j,k);
    \endcode
    
    The other arrays are 2D (or 4D if you include i,j,k) in nature. They can be indexed with the appropriate Index2D
    from getCellListIndexer() or getCellAdjIndexer(). 
    \code
    Index2D cell_list_indexer = cl->getCellListIndexer();
    Index2D cell_adj_indexer = cl->getCellAdjIndexer();
    \endcode
    
     - <code>cell_size[cidx]</code> is the number of particles in the cell with index \c cidx
     - \c xyzf is Ncells x Nmax and <code>xyzf[cell_list_indexer(offset,cidx)]</code> is the data stored for particle
       \c offset in cell \c cidx (\c offset can vary from 0 to <code>cell_size[cidx]-1</code>)
     - \c tbd, idx, and orientation is structured identically to \c xyzf
     - <code>cell_adj[cell_adj_indexer(offset,cidx)]</code> is the cell index for neighboring cell \c offset to \c cidx.
       \c offset can vary from 0 to (radius*2+1)^3-1 (typically 26 with radius 1)
     
    <b>Parameters:</b>
     - \c width - minimum width of a cell in any x,y,z direction
     - \c radius - integer radius of cells to generate in \c cell_adj (1,2,3,4,...)
     - \c max_cells - maximum number of cells to allocate
     - \c multiple - Round down to the nearest multiple number of cells in each direction (only applied to cells
                     inside the domain, not the ghost cells).
     
    After a set call is made to adjust a parameter, changes do not take effect until the next call to compute().

    <b>Overvlow and error flag handling:</b>
    For easy support of derived GPU classes to implement overvlow detection and error handling, all error flags are
    stored in the GPUArray \a d_conditions.
     - 0: Maximum cell size (implementations are free to write to this element only in overflow conditions if they
          choose.)
     - 1: Set to non-zero if any particle has nan coordinates
     - 2: Set to non-zero if any particle is outside of the addressable bins

    Condition flags are to be set during the computeCellList() call and will be checked by compute() which will then 
    take the appropriate action. If possible, flags 1 and 2 should be set to the index of the particle causing the
    flag plus 1.
