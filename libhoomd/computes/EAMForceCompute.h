//! Computes Lennard-Jones forces on each particle
/*! The total pair force is summed for each particle when compute() is called. Forces are only summed between
    neighboring particles with a separation distance less than \c r_cut. A NeighborList must be provided
    to identify these neighbors. Calling compute() in this class will in turn result in a call to the
    NeighborList's compute() to make sure that the neighbor list is up to date.

    Usage: Construct a EAMForceCompute, providing it an already constructed ParticleData and NeighborList.
    Then set parameters for all possible pairs of types by calling setParams.

    Forces can be computed directly by calling compute() and then retrieved with a call to acquire(), but
    a more typical usage will be to add the force compute to NVEUpdater or NVTUpdater.
