//! Handy structure for passing the force arrays around

    components of the force on that particle. \a pe is also included as the potential energy
    for each particle, if it can be defined for the force. \a virial is the per particle virial.

    The per particle potential energy is defined such that \f$ \sum_i^N \mathrm{pe}_i = V_{\mathrm{total}} \f$

    The per particle virial is a upper triangular 3x3 matrix that is defined such
    that
