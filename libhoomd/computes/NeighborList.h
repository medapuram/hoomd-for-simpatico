//! Computes a Neibhorlist from the particles
/*! \b Overview:

    A particle \c i is a neighbor of particle \c j if the distance between
    particle them is less than or equal to \c r_cut. The neighborlist for a given particle
    \c i includes all of these neighbors at a minimum. Other particles particles are included
    in the list: those up to \c r_max which includes a buffer distance so that the neighbor list
    doesn't need to be updated every step.

    There are two ways of storing this information. One is to store only half of the
    neighbors (only those with i < j), and the other is to store all neighbors. There are
    potential tradeoffs between number of computations and memory access complexity for
    each method. NeighborList supports both of these modes via a switch: setStorageMode();

    Some classes with either setting, full or half, but they are faster with the half setting. However,
    others may require that the neighbor list storage mode is set to full.
    
    <b>Data access:</b>
    
    Up to Nmax neighbors can be stored for each particle. Data is stored in a 2D matrix array in memory. Each element
    in the matrix stores the index of the neighbor with the highest bits reserved for flags. An indexer for accessing
    elements can be gotten with getNlistIndexer() and the array itself can be accessed with getNlistArray().

    The number of neighbors for each particle is stored in an auxilliary array accessed with getNNeighArray().
    
     - <code>jf = nlist[nlist_indexer(i,n)]</code> is the index of neighbor \a n of particle \a i, where \a n can vary from
       0 to <code>n_neigh[i] - 1</code>
    
    \a jf includes flags in the highest bits. The format and use of these flags are yet to be determined.
    
    \b Filtering:
    
    By default, a neighbor list includes all particles within a single cutoff distance r_cut. Various filters can be
    applied to remove unwanted neighbors from the list.
     - setFilterBody() prevents two particles of the same body from being neighbors
     - setFilterRcutType() enables individual r_cut values for each pair of particle types
     - setFilterDiameter() enables slj type diameter filtering (TODO: need to specify exactly what this does)
    
    \b Algorithms:

    This base class supplys a dumb O(N^2) algorithm for generating this list. It is very
    slow, but functional. Derived classes implement O(N) efficient straetegies using the CellList.

    <b>Needs updage check:</b>

    When compute() is called, the neighbor list is updated, but only if it needs to be. Checks
    are performed to see if any particle has moved more than half of the buffer distance, and
    only then is the list actually updated. This check can even be avoided for a number of time
    steps by calling setEvery(). If the caller wants to forces a full update, forceUpdate()
    can be called before compute() to do so. Note that if the particle data is resorted,
    an update is automatically forced.

    The CUDA profiler expects the exact same sequence of kernels on every run. Due to the non-deterministic cell list,
    a different sequence of calls may be generated with nlist builds at different times. To work around this problem
    setEvery takes a dist_check parameter. When dist_check=True, the above described behavior is followed. When
    dist_check is false, the nlist is built exactly m_every steps. This is intended for use in profiling only.
    
    \b Exclusions:
    
    Exclusions are stored in \a ex_list, a data structure similar in structure to \a nlist, except this time exclusions
    are stored. User-specified exclusions are stored by tag and translated to indices whenever a particle sort occurs
    (updateExListIdx()). If any exclusions are set, filterNlist() is called after buildNlist(). filterNlist() loops
    through the neighbor list and removes any particles that are excluded. This allows an arbitrary number of exclusions
    to be processed without slowing the performance of the buildNlist() step itself.
    
    <b>Overvlow handling:</b>
    For easy support of derived GPU classes to implement overvlow detectio the overflow condition is storeed in the
    GPUArray \a d_conditions.
    
     - 0: Maximum nlist size (implementations are free to write to this element only in overflow conditions if they
          choose.)
     - Further indices may be added to handle other conditions at a later time.

    Condition flags are to be set during the buildNlist() call and will be checked by compute() which will then 
    take the appropriate action.
