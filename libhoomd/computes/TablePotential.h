//! Computes the potential and force on each particle based on values given in a table
/*! \b Overview
    Pair potentials and forces are evaluated for all particle pairs in the system within the given cutoff distances.
    Both the potentials and forces** are provided the tables V(r) and F(r) at discreet \a r values between \a rmin and
    \a rmax. Evaluations are performed by simple linear interpolation, thus why F(r) must be explicitly specified to
    avoid large errors resulting from the numerical derivative. Note that F(r) should store - dV/dr.

    \b Table memory layout

    V(r) and F(r) are specified for each unique particle type pair. They will be indexed so that values of increasing r
    go along the rows in memory for cache efficiency when reading values. The row index to put the potential at can be
    determined using an Index2DUpperTriangular (typei, typej), as it will uniquely index each unique pair.

    To improve cache coherency even further, values for V and F will be interleaved like so: V1 F1 V2 F2 V3 F3 ... To
    accomplish this, tables are stored with a value type of float2, elem.x will be V and elem.y will be F. Since Fn,
    Vn+1 and Fn+1 are read right after Vn, these are likely to be cache hits. Furthermore, on the GPU a single float2
    texture read can be used to access Vn and Fn.

    Three parameters need to be stored for each potential: rmin, rmax, and dr, the minimum r, maximum r, and spacing
    between r values in the table respectively. For simple access on the GPU, these will be stored in a float4 where
    x is rmin, y is rmax, and z is dr. They are indexed with the same Index2DUpperTriangular as the tables themselves.

    V(0) is the value of V at r=rmin. V(i) is the value of V at r=rmin + dr * i where i is chosen such that r >= rmin
    and r <= rmax. V(r) for r < rmin and > rmax is 0. The same goes for F. Thus V and F are defined between the region
    [rmin,rmax], inclusive.

    For ease of storing the data, all tables must be of the same number of points for all type pairs.

    \b Interpolation
    Values are interpolated linearly between two points straddling the given r. For a given r, the first point needed, i
    can be calculated via i = floorf((r - rmin) / dr). The fraction between ri and ri+1 can be calculated via
    f = (r - rmin) / dr - float(i). And the linear interpolation can then be performed via V(r) ~= Vi + f * (Vi+1 - Vi)
