    gpu_nlist_filter_kernel() processes the neighbor list \a d_nlist and removes any entries that are excluded. To allow
    for an arbitrary large number of exclusions, these are processed in batch sizes of FILTER_BATCH_SIZE. The kernel
    must be called multiple times in order to fully remove all exclusions from the nlist. 
    
    \note The driver gpu_nlist_filter properly makes as many calls as are necessary, it only needs to be called once.
    
    \b Implementation
    
    One thread is run for each particle. Exclusions \a ex_start, \a ex_start + 1, ... are loaded in for that particle
    (or the thread returns if there are no exlusions past that point). The thread then loops over the neighbor list,
    comparing each entry to the list of exclusions. If the entry is not excluded, it is written back out. \a d_n_neigh
    is updated to reflect the current number of particles in the list at the end of the kernel call.
