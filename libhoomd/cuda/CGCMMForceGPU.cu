//! Kernel for calculating CG-CMM Lennard-Jones forces
/*! This kernel is called to calculate the Lennard-Jones forces on all N particles for the CG-CMM model potential.

    \param d_force Device memory to write computed forces
    \param d_virial Device memory to write computed virials
    \param virial_pitch pitch of 2D virial array
    \param N number of particles
    \param d_pos particle positions on the GPU
    \param d_n_neigh Device memory array listing the number of neighbors for each particle
    \param d_nlist Device memory array containing the neighbor list contents
    \param nli Indexer for indexing \a d_nlist
    \param d_coeffs Coefficients to the lennard jones force (lj12, lj9, lj6, lj4).
    \param coeff_width Width of the coefficient matrix
    \param r_cutsq Precalculated r_cut*r_cut, where r_cut is the radius beyond which forces are
    set to 0
    \param box Box dimensions used to implement periodic boundary conditions

    \a coeffs is a pointer to a matrix in memory. \c coeffs[i*coeff_width+j].x is \a lj12 for the type pair \a i, \a j.
    Similarly, .y, .z, and .w are the \a lj9, \a lj6, and \a lj4 parameters, respectively. The values in d_coeffs are
    read into shared memory, so \c coeff_width*coeff_width*sizeof(float4) bytes of extern shared memory must be allocated
    for the kernel call.

    Developer information:
    Each block will calculate the forces on a block of particles.
    Each thread will calculate the total force on one particle.
    The neighborlist is arranged in columns so that reads are fully coalesced when doing this.
