    gpu_dihedraltable_array for more info.

    A ParticleData instance owns a single DihedralData which classes such as DihedralForceCompute
    can access for their needs.

    Dihedrals can be dynamically added, although doing this on a per-timestep basis can
    slow performance significantly. For simplicity and convinence, however, the number
    of dihedral types cannot change after initialization.
