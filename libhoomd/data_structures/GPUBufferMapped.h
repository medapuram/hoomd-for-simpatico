//! Class for managing a buffer to copy data between the host and the GPU
/*! GPUBufferMapped is a class that manages a mapped pinned memory buffer.
    It provides two methods to access the data: getHostPointer() returns a pointer to the host buffer,
    and getDevicePointer() returns the pointer to the device memory. Data written to the host data
    is automatically available on the device, and data written to the device buffer is seen on the host
    after a call to getHostPointer().

    The class is used for data that needs to be frequently exchanged between the GPU and the host.

    Similar to GPUArray, it supports methods for resizing as well as 2D buffers.
