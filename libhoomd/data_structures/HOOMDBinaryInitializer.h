//! Forward definition of SnapshotSystemData
class SnapshotSystemData;

//! Initializes particle data from a Hoomd input file
/*! The input XML file format is identical to the output XML file format that HOOMDDumpWriter writes.
    For more information on the XML file format design see \ref page_dev_info. Although, HOOMD's
    user guide probably has a more up to date documentation on the format.

    When HOOMDBinaryInitializer is instantiated, it reads in the XML file specified in the constructor
    and parses it into internal data structures. The initializer is then ready to be passed
    to ParticleData which will then make the needed calls to copy the data into its representation.

    HOOMD's XML file format and this class are designed to be very extensible. Parsers for inidividual
    XML nodes are written in separate functions and stored by name in the map \c m_parser_map. As the
    main parser loops through, it reads in xml nodes and fires of parsers from this map to parse each
    of them. Adding a new node to the file format parser is as simple as adding a new node parser function
    (like parsePositionNode()) and adding it to the map in the constructor.
