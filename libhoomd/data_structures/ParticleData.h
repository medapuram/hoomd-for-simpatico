/*! <h1> General </h1>
    ParticleData stores and manages particle coordinates, velocities, accelerations, type,
    and tag information. This data must be available both via the CPU and GPU memories.
    All copying of data back and forth from the GPU is accomplished transparently by GPUArray.

    For performance reasons, data is stored as simple arrays. Once a handle to the particle data
    GPUArrays has been acquired, the coordinates of the particle with
    <em>index</em> \c i can be accessed with <code>pos_array_handle.data[i].x</code>,
    <code>pos_array_handle.data[i].y</code>, and <code>pos_array_handle.data[i].z</code>
    where \c i runs from 0 to <code>getN()</code>.

    Velocities and other properties can be accessed in a similar manner.
    
    \note Position and type are combined into a single Scalar4 quantity. x,y,z specifies the position and w specifies
    the type. Use __scalar_as_int() / __int_as_scalar() (or __int_as_float() / __float_as_int()) to extract / set
    this integer that is masquerading as a scalar.
    
    \note Velocity and mass are combined into a single Scalar4 quantity. x,y,z specifies the velocity and w specifies
    the mass.

    \warning Local particles can and will be rearranged in the arrays throughout a simulation.
    So, a particle that was once at index 5 may be at index 123 the next time the data
    is acquired. Individual particles can be tracked through all these changes by their (global) tag.
    The tag of a particle is stored in the \c m_tag array, and the ith element contains the tag of the particle
    with index i. Conversely, the the index of a particle with tag \c tag can be read from
    the element at position \c tag in the a \c m_rtag array.

    In a parallel simulation, the global tag is unique among all processors.

    In order to help other classes deal with particles changing indices, any class that
    changes the order must call notifyParticleSort(). Any class interested in being notified
    can subscribe to the signal by calling connectParticleSort().

    Some fields in ParticleData are not computed and assigned by default because they require additional processing
    time. PDataFlags is a bitset that lists which flags (enumerated in pdata_flag) are enable/disabled. Computes should
    call getFlags() and compute the requested quantities whenever the corresponding flag is set. Updaters and Analyzers
    can request flags be computed via their getRequestedPDataFlags() methods. A particular updater or analyzer should 
    return a bitset PDataFlags with only the bits set for the flags that it needs. During a run, System will query
    the updaters and analyzers that are to be executed on the current step. All of the flag requests are combined
    with the binary or operation into a single set of flag requests. System::run() then sets the flags by calling
    setPDataFlags so that the computes produce the requested values during that step.
    
    These fields are:
     - pdata_flag::isotropic_virial - specify that the net_virial should be/is computed (getNetVirial)
     - pdata_flag::potential_energy - specify that the potential energy .w component stored in the net force array 
       (getNetForce) is valid
     - pdata_flag::pressure_tensor - specify that the full virial tensor is valid
       
    If these flags are not set, these arrays can still be read but their values may be incorrect.
    
    If any computation is unable to supply the appropriate values (i.e. rigid body virial can not be computed
    until the second step of the simulation), then it should remove the flag to signify that the values are not valid.
    Any analyzer/updater that expects the value to be set should check the flags that are actually set.
    
    \note Particles are not checked if their position is actually inside the local box. In fact, when using spatial domain decomposition,
    particles may temporarily move outside the boundaries.

    \ingroup data_structs
    
    ## Parallel simulations

    In a parallel (or domain decompositon) simulation, the ParticleData may either correspond to the global state of the
    simulation (e.g. before and after a simulation run), or to the local particles only (e.g. during a simulation run).
    In the latter case, getN() returns the current number of \a local particles. The method getNGlobal() can be used to query the \a global number
    of particles on all processors.

    During the simulation particles may enter or leave the box, therefore the number of \a local particles may change.
    To account for this, the size of the particle data arrays is dynamically updated using amortized doubling of the array sizes. To add particles to
    the domain, the addParticles() method is called, and the arrays are resized if necessary. Conversely, if particles are removed,
    the removeParticles() method is called.

    In addition, since many other classes maintain internal arrays with data for every particle (such as neighbor lists etc.), these
    arrays need to be resized, too, if the particle number changes. Everytime the particle data arrays are reallocated, a
    maximum particle number change signal is triggered. Other classes can subscribe to this signal using connectMaxParticleNumberChange().
    They may use the current maxium size of the particle arrays, which is returned by getMaxN().
    This size changes only infrequently (it is doubled when necessary, see above). Note that getMaxN() can return a higher number
    than the actual number of particles.

    \note addParticles() and removeParticles() only change the particle number counters and the allocated memory size (if necessary).
    They do not actually change any data in the particle arrays. The caller is responsible for (re-)organizing the particle data when particles
    are added or deleted.

    If, after insertion or deletion of particles, the reorganisation of the particle data is complete, i.e. all the particle data
    fields are filled, the class that has modified the ParticleData must inform other classes about the new particle data
    using notifyParticleSort().

    Particle data also stores temporary particles ('ghost atoms'). These are added after the local particle data (i.e. with indices
    starting at getN()). It keeps track of those particles using the addGhostParticles() and removeAllGhostParticles() methods.
    The caller is responsible for updating the particle data arrays with the ghost particle information.

    ## Anisotropic particles

    Anisotropic particles are handled by storing an orientation quaternion for every particle in the simulation.
    Similarly, a net torque is computed and stored for each particle. The design decision made is to not
    duplicate efforts already made to enable composite bodies of anisotropic particles. So the particle orientation
    is a read only quantity when used by most of HOOMD. To integrate this degree of freedom forward, the particle
    must be part of a composite body (stored and handled by RigidData) (there can be single-particle bodies,
    of course) where integration methods like NVERigid will handle updating the degrees of freedom of the composite
    body and then set the constrained position, velocity, and orientation of the constituent particles.
    
    To enable correct initialization of the composite body moment of inertia, each particle is also assigned
    an individual moment of inertia which is summed up correctly to determine the composite body's total moment of
    inertia. As such, the initial particle moment of inertias are only ever used during initialization and do not
    need to be stored in an efficient GPU data structure. Nor does the inertia tensor data need to be resorted,
    so it will always remain in tag order.
    
    Access the orientation quaternion of each particle with the GPUArray gotten from getOrientationArray(), the net
    torque with getTorqueArray(). Individual inertia tensor values can be accessed with getInertiaTensor() and
    setInertiaTensor()
    
    ## Origin shifting
    
    Parallel MC simulations randomly translate all particles by a fixed vector at periodic intervals. This motion 
    is not physical, it is merely the easiest way to shift the origin of the cell list / domain decomposition
    boundaries. Analysis routines (i.e. MSD) and movies are complicated by the random motion of all particles.
    
    ParticleData can track this origin and subtract it from all particles. This subtraction is done when taking a
    snapshot. Putting the subtraction there naturally puts the correction there for all analysis routines and file I/O
    while leaving the shifted particles in place for computes, updaters, and integrators. On the restoration from
    a snapshot, the origin needs to be cleared.
    
    Two routines support this: translateOrigin() and resetOrigin(). The position of the origin is tracked by
    ParticleData internally. translateOrigin() moves it by a given vector. resetOrigin() zeroes it. TODO: This might
    not be sufficient for simulations where the box size changes. We'll see in testing.
