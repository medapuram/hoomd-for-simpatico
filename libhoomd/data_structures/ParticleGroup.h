//! Utility class to select particles based on given conditions
/*! \b Overview
    
    In order to flexibly specify the particles that belong to a given ParticleGroup, it will simple take a
    ParticleSelector as a parameter in its constructor. The selector will provide a true/false membership test that will
    be applied to each particle tag, selecting those that belong in the group. As it is specified via a virtual class,
    the group definition can be expanded to include any concievable selection criteria.
    
    <b>Implementation details</b>
    So that an infinite range of selection criteria can be applied (i.e. particles with mass > 2.0, or all particles
    bonded to particle j, ...) the selector will get a reference to the SystemDefinition on construction, along with
    any parameters to specify the selection criteria. Then, a simple isSelected() test is provided that will acquire the
    needed data and will return true if that particle meets the criteria.
    
    The base class isSelected() method will simply reject all particles. Derived classes will implement specific
    selection semantics.

/*! \b Overview
    
    Some computations in HOOMD need to only be performed on certain groups of particles. ParticleGroup facilitates
    that by providing a flexible interface for choosing these groups that can be used by any other class in HOOMD.
    
    The following common use-cases are expected and the design is tuned to make these optimal.
     - Iterate through all particles indices in the group, and the order of iteration doesn't matter, except for 
       performance.
     - Iterate through all particle tags in the group, in a well-defined order that does not change (namely, a sorted
       tag order is required)
     - O(1) test if a particular particle index is in the group

    Membership in the group is determined through a generic ParticleSelector class. See its documentation for details.

    Group membership is determined once at the instantiation of the group. Thus ParticleGroup only supports static
    groups where membership does not change over the course of a simulation. Dynamic groups, if they are needed,
    may require a drastically different design to allow for efficient access.

    In many use-cases, ParticleGroup may be accessed many times within inner loops. Thus, it must not aquire any
    ParticleData arrays within most of the get() calls as the caller must be allowed to leave their ParticleData 
    aquired. Thus, all get() methods must return values from internal cached variables only. Those methods that
    absolutely require the particle data be released before they are called will be documented as such.

    <b>Data Structures and Implementation</b>

    The initial and fundamental data structure in the group is a vector listing all of the particle tags in the group,
    in a sorted tag order. This list can be accessed directly via getMemberTag() to meet the 2nd use case listed above.
    In order to iterate through all particles in the group in a cache-efficient manner, an auxilliary list is stored
    that lists all particle <i>indicies</i> that belong to the group. This list must be updated on every particle sort.
    Thirdly, a dynamic bitset is used to store one bit per particle for efficient O(1) tests if a given particle is in 
    the group.
    
    Finally, the common use case on the GPU using groups will include running one thread per particle in the group.
    For that it needs a list of indices of all the particles in the group. To facilitates this, the list of indices
    in the group will be stored in a GPUArray.
