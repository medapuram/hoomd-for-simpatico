//! Stores particles as they are generated in RandomGenerator
/*! \ingroup data_structs
    GeneratedParticles is a holding area where particles are stored when
    being generated by RandomGenerator and ParticleGenerator instances.

    It includes helper functions and data structures for placing particles
    that do not overlap. These helpers use the radius for each particle type
    as specified by setSeparationRadius(). Every particle type that will be
    generated must be specified before generation can begin.

    After all particles are placed in GeneratedParticles, RandomGenerator will
    then translate that data over to ParticleData in the initializer.

//! Generates a random particle system given a set of ParticleGenerator classes
/*! \ingroup data_structs
    RandomGenerator is the high level Initializer that brings all the pieces together to
    generate a random system of particles. The structure and types of the particles generated
    (i.e. a polymer system of A6B7A6 polymers) is determined by the ParticleGenerator classes
    that are added.

    Mixture systems can be created by adding more than one ParticleGenerator.
    class. Testing should be done to confirm this, but it is probably best to
    add the largest objects first so that smaller ones can be generated around them.

    By default, bonds are named "bond". This can be changed by calling setBondType().

    \b Usage:<br>
    Before the initializer can be passed to a ParticleData for initialization, the following
    steps must be performed.
     -# Contstruct a RandomGenerator (duh) with a given box size
     -# Set radii for all particle types to be generated
     -# Construct and add any number of ParticleGenerator instances to the RandomGenerator
     -# Call generate() to actually place the particles
