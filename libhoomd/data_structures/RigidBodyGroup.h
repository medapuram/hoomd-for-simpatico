//! Describes a group of rigid bodies
/*! \b Overview
    
    Some computations in HOOMD need to only be performed on certain groups of rigid bodies. Such groups are initialized
    from an already existing ParticleGroup for simplicity and integration into the rest of HOOMD.
    
    The following common use-cases are expected and the design is tuned to make these optimal.
     - Iterate through all rigid body indices in the group, and the order of iteration doesn't matter, except for 
       performance.
     - O(1) test if a particular body index is in the group

    Group membership is determined once at the instantiation of the group. Thus RigidBodyGroup only supports static
    groups where membership does not change over the course of a simulation. Dynamic groups, if they are needed, 
    may require a drastically different design to allow for efficient access.
    
    Membership is determined based on the particle members in a ParticleGroup. If only a portion of a body is included
    in the ParticleGroup, the body is included, and a warning is also issue to the user that a body has been partially
    selected.

    In many use-cases, RigidBodyGroup may be accessed many times within inner loops. Thus, it must not aquire any
    ParticleData arrays within most of the get() calls as the caller must be allowed to leave their ParticleData 
    aquired. Thus, all get() methods must return values from internal cached variables only. Those methods that
    absolutely require the particle data be released before they are called will be documented as such.

    <b>Data Structures and Implementation</b>
    
    The initial and fundamental data structure in the group is a vector listing all of the bodies in the group,
    in a sorted index order. This list can be accessed directly via getMemberIndex() to meet the 1st use case listed
    above. A dynamic bitset is used to store one bit per rigid body for efficient O(1) tests if a given body is in 
    the group.
    
    Finally, the common use case on the GPU using groups will include threads that access the group membership.
    For that it needs a list of indices of all the bodies in the group. To facilitates this, the list of indices
    in the group will be stored in a GPUArray.
