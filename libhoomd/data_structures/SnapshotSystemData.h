//! Structure for initializing system data
/*! A snapshot is used for multiple purposes:
 * 1. for initializing the system
 * 2. during the simulation, e.g. to dump the system state or to analyze it
 *
 * Snapshots are temporary data-structures, they are only used for passing around data.
 *
 * A SnapshotSystemData is just a super-structure that holds snapshots of other data, such
 * as particles, bonds, rigid bodies, etc. It is used by the SystemDefinition class to initially
 * set up these data structures, and can also be obtained from an object of that class to
 * analyze the current system state.
