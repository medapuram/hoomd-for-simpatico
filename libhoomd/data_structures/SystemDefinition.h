/*! SystemDefinition is a big bucket where all of the data defining the MD system goes.
    Everything is stored as a shared pointer for quick and easy access from within C++
    and python without worrying about data management.

    <b>Background and intended usage</b>

    The most fundamental data structure stored in SystemDefinition is the ParticleData.
    It stores essential data on a per particle basis (position, velocity, type, mass, etc...)
    as well as defining the number of particles in the system and the simulation box. Many other
    data structures in SystemDefinition also refer to particles and store other data related to
    them (i.e. BondData lists bonds between particles). These will need access to information such
    as the number of particles in the system or potentially some of the per-particle data stored
    in ParticleData. To facilitate this, ParticleData will always be initialized \b fist and its
    shared pointer can then be passed to any future data structure in SystemDefinition that needs
    such a reference.

    More generally, any data structure class in SystemDefinition can potentially reference any other,
    simply by giving the shared pointer to the referenced class to the constructor of the one that
    needs to refer to it. Note that using this setup, there can be no circular references. This is a
    \b good \b thing ^TM, as it promotes good separation and isolation of the various classes responsibilities.

    In rare circumstances, a references back really is required (i.e. notification of referring classes when
    ParticleData resorts particles). Any event based notifications of such should be managed with boost::signals.
    Any ongoing references where two data structure classes are so interwoven that they must constantly refer to
    each other should be avoided (consider merging them into one class).

    <b>Initializing</b>

    A default constructed SystemDefinition is full of NULL shared pointers. Such is intended to be assigned to
    by one created by a SystemInitializer.

    Several other default constructors are provided, mainly to provide backward compatibility to unit tests that
    relied on the simple initialization constructors provided by ParticleData.
