//! Class for evaluating the force shifted LJ pair potential
/*! This evaluator is a variant of the Lennard-Jones pair potential, for which the force goes smoothly
    to zero at \f$ r = r_{\mathrm{cut}} \f$.

    EvaluatorPairForceShiftedLJ evaluates the function:
    \f[ V(r) = V_{LJ}(r) + \Delta V(r) \f], where
    \f[ V_{\mathrm{LJ}}(r) = 4 \varepsilon \left[ \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{12} -
                                            \alpha \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{6} \right] \f]
    is the standard Lennard-Jones pair potential and
    \f[ \Delta V(r) = -(r - r_{\mathrm{cut}}) \frac{\partial V_{\mathrm{LJ}}}{\partial r}(r_{\mathrm{cut}}) \f].
    The constant value \f$[ -\frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial V}{\partial r}(r_{\mathrm{cut}}) \f$ is
        subtracted from \a force_divr .

    The two parameters \a lj1 and \a lj2 are the same as for the (non-force-shifted) LJ potential.
