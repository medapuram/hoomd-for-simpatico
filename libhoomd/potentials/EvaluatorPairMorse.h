//! Class for evaluating the Morse pair potential
/*! <b>General Overview</b>

    See EvaluatorPairLJ.
    
    <b>Morse specifics</b>
    
    EvaluatorPairMorse evaluates the function:
    \f[ V_{\mathrm{Morse}}(r) = D_0 \left[ \exp \left(-2\alpha \left(r - r_0\right) \right) 
                                           -2\exp \left(-\alpha \left(r-r_0\right) \right)  \right] \f]
        
    Morse potential does not need diameter or charge. Three parameters are specified and stored in a Scalar4, for speed. 
    \a \f[ D_0 \f] is placed in \a params.x, \a \f[ \alpha \f] is in \a params.y, and \f[ r_0 \f] is in \a params.z. 
    \a param.w is always set to zero, and is ignored.
