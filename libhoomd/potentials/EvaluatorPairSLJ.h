/*! <b>General Overview</b>

    See EvaluatorPairLJ
    
    <b>SLJ specifics</b>
    
    EvaluatorPairSLJ evaluates the function:
    \f{eqnarray*}
    V_{\mathrm{SLJ}}(r)  = & 4 \varepsilon \left[ \left( \frac{\sigma}{r - \Delta} \right)^{12} - 
                           \left( \frac{\sigma}{r - \Delta} \right)^{6} \right] & r < (r_{\mathrm{cut}} + \Delta) \\
                         = & 0 & r \ge (r_{\mathrm{cut}} + \Delta) \\
    \f}
    where \f$ \Delta = (d_i + d_j)/2 - 1 \f$ and \f$ d_i \f$ is the diameter of particle \f$ i \f$.
    
    The SLJ potential does not need charge, but does need diameter. Two parameters are specified and stored in a
    Scalar2. \a lj1 is placed in \a params.x and \a lj2 is in \a params.y.
    
    These are related to the standard lj parameters sigma and epsilon by:
    - \a lj1 = 4.0 * epsilon * pow(sigma,12.0)
    - \a lj2 = 4.0 * epsilon * pow(sigma,6.0);
  
    Due to the way that SLJ modifies the cutoff condition, it will not function properly with the xplor shifting mode.
