//! Integrates part of the system forward in two steps
/*! \b Overview
    A large class of integrators can be implemented in two steps:
    - Update position and velocity (w/ current accel)
    - Sum accelerations at the current position
    - Update position and velocity again (w/ newly calculated accel)
    
    It is also sometimes desierable to run part of the system with one integration method (i.e. NVE) and part with
    another (NPT). Or part of the system with an integrator and the other part none at all. To facilitate this, the
    IntegrationMethodTwoStep is being created. It is a generic class, of which sub classes (TwoStepNVT, TwoStepNVE, ...)
    will implement the specific two step integration method. A single integrator, IntegratorTwoStep, can contain
    several two step integration methods. It calls the first step on all of them, then calculates the forces, and then
    calls the second step on all methods. In this way, the entire system will be integrated forward correctly.
    
    This design is chosen so that a single integration method is only applied to a group of particles. To enforce this
    design constraint, the group is specified in the constructor to the base class method.
    
    However, some care needs to be put into thinking about the computation of the net force / accelerations. Prior to
    implementing IntegrationMethodTwoStep, Integrators on the CPU have the net force and acceleration summed in
    Integrator::computeAccelerations. While the GPU ones only compute the forces in that call, and sum the net force
    and acceleration within the 2nd step of the integrator. In an interaction with groups, this is not going to work
    out. If one integration method worked one way and another worked the other in the same IntegratorTwoStep, then
    the net force / acceleration would probably not be calculated properly. To avoid this problem, a net force and
    virial will summed within Integrator::computeNetForce() / Integrator::computeNetForceGPU() which is called at the
    proper time in IntegratorTwoStep() (and presumably other integration routines).
        
    One small note: each IntegrationTwoStep will have a deltaT. The value of this will be set by the integrator when
    Integrator::setDeltaT is called to ensure that all integration methods have the same delta t set.
    
    <b>Integrator variables</b>
    
    Integrator variables are registered and tracked, if needed, through the IntegratorData interface. Because of the
    need for valid restart tracking (see below), \b all integrators register even if they do not need to save state
    information.
    
    Furthermore, the base class IntegratorTwoStep needs to know whether or not it should recalculate the "first step"
    accelerations. Accelerations are saved in the restart file, so if a restart is valid for all of the integration
    methods, it should skip that step. To facilitate this, derived classes should call setValidRestart(true) if they
    have valid restart information.
    
    <b>Thermodynamic properties</b>
    
    Thermodynamic properties on given groups are computed by ComputeThermo. See the documentation of ComputeThermo for
    its design and logging capabilities. To compute temperature properly, ComputeThermo needs the number of degrees of
    freedom. Only the Integrator can know that as it is the integrator that grants degrees of freedom to the particles.
    hoomd_script will break the dependancy requirement. At the start of every run, hoomd_script will ask for an updated
    NDOF for every ComputeThermo group and set it.
    
    For IntegratorTwoStep, each IntegrationMethodTwoStep will compute its own contribution to the degrees of freedom
    for each particle in the group. IntegratorTwoStep will sum the contributions to get the total. At that point, 
    D will be deducted from the total to get the COM motion constraint correct.
    
    <b>Design requirements</b>
    Due to the nature of allowing multiple integration methods to run at once, some strict guidlines need to be laid
    down.
    -# All methods must use the same \a deltaT (this is enforced by having IntegratorTwoStep call setDeltaT on all of
       the methods inside it.
    -# integrateStepOne uses the particle acceleration currently set to advance particle positions forward one full
       step, and velocities are advanced forward a half step.
    -# integrateStepTwo assigns the current particle acceleration from the net force and updates the velocities
       forward for the second half step
    -# each integration method only applies these operations to the particles contained within its group (exceptions
       are allowed when box rescaling is needed)
    
    <b>Design items still left to do:</b>
    
    Interaction with logger: perhaps the integrator should forward log value queries on to the integration method? 
    each method could be given a user name so that they are logged in user-controlled columns. This provides a window
    into the interally computed state variables logging per method.
