//! Base class that defines an integrator
/*! An Integrator steps the entire simulation forward one time step in time.
    Prior to calling update(timestep), the system is at time step \a timestep.
    After the call to update completes, the system is at \a timestep + 1.

    All integrators have the common property that they add up many forces to
    get the net force on each particle. This task is performed by the
    base class Integrator. Similarly, all integrators share the
    property that they have a time step, \a deltaT.

    Any number of ForceComputes can be used to specify the net force
    for use with this integrator. They are added via calling
    addForceCompute(). Any number of forces can be added in this way. 
    
    All forces added via addForceCompute() are computed independantly and then totaled up to calculate the net force
    and enrgy on each particle. Constraint forces (ForceConstraint) are unique in that they need to be computed 
    \b after the net forces is already available. To implement this behavior, call addForceConstraint() to add any
    number of constraint forces. All constraint forces will be computed independantly and will be able to read the
    current unconstrained net force. Separate constraint forces should not overlap. Degrees of freedom removed
    via the constraint forces can be totaled up with a call to getNDOFRemoved for convenience in derived classes
    implementing correct counting in getNDOF().

    Integrators take "ownership" of the particle's accellerations. Any other updater
    that modifies the particles accelerations will produce undefined results. If
    accelerations are to be modified, they must be done through forces, and added to
    an Integrator via addForceCompute().

    No such ownership is taken of the particle positions and velocities. Other Updaters
    can modify particle positions and velocities as they wish. Those updates will be taken
    into account by the Integrator. It would probably make the most sense to have such updaters
    run BEFORE the Integrator, since an Integrator actually moves the particles to the next time
    step. This is handled correctly by System.
