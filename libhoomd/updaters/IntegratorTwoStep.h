    \brief Declares an integrator for performing two-step integration on multiple groups
*/

#ifdef NVCC
#error This header cannot be compiled by nvcc

//! Integrates the system forward one step with possibly multiple methods
/*! See IntegrationMethodTwoStep for most of the design notes regarding group integration. IntegratorTwoStep merely
    implements most of the things discussed there.
    
    Notable design elements:
    - setDeltaT results in deltaT being set on all current integration methods
    - to ensure that new methods also get set, addIntegrationMethod() also calls setDeltaT on the method
    - to interface with the python script, a removeAllIntegrationMethods() method is provided to clear the list so they
      can be cleared and re-added from hoomd_script's internal list
    
    To ensure that the user does not make a mistake and specify more than one method operating on a single particle,
    the particle groups are checked for intersections whenever a new method is added in addIntegrationMethod()
