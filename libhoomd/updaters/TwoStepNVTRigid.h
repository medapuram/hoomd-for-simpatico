//! Updates particle positions and velocities
/*! This updater performes constant N, constant volume, constant temperature (NVT) dynamics. Particle positions and velocities are
    updated according to the velocity verlet algorithm. The forces that drive this motion are defined external to this class
    in ForceCompute. Any number of ForceComputes can be given, the resulting forces will be summed to produce a net force on
    each particle.
