//! Performs updates of ParticleData structures
/*! The Updater is an abstract concept that takes a particle data structure and changes it in some way.
    For example, an updater may make a verlet step and update the particle positions to the next timestep.
    Or, it may force a certain particle to be in a certain location. Or, it may sort the particle data
    so that the many Computes suffer far fewer cache misses. The possibilities are endless.

    The base class just defines an update method. Since updaters can reference Compute's, the timestep
    is passed in so that it can be forwarded on to the Compute. Of course, the timestep can also be used
    for time dependant updaters, such as a moving temperature set point. Of course, when an updater is changing
    particle positions/velocities etc... the line between when a timestep begins and ends blurs. See the System class
    for a clear definition.
