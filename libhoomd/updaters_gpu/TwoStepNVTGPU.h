    In order to compute efficiently and limit the number of kernel launches integrateStepOne() performs a first
    pass reduction on the sum of m*v^2 and stores the partial reductions. A second kernel is then launched to recude
    those to a final \a sum2K, which is a scalar but stored in a GPUArray for convenience.
