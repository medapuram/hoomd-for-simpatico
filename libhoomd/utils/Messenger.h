//! Utility class for controlling message printing
/*! Large code projects need something more inteligent than just cout's for warning and
    notices and cerr for errors. To aid in user debugging, multiple levels of notice messages are required. Not all
    notice levels need to be printed in every run. A notice level can be set to control how much information is printed.
    Furthermore, in MPI runs not all processes need to print messages or one may wan to log the output of every rank to
    a different file.

    The Messenger class solves these issues. It provides a set of message levels that can be linked to chosen streams.
    The streams are returned by function calls so that users of this class can do the following:
    \code
    msg.error() << "Bad input" << endl;
    msg.warning() << "I hope you know what you are doing" << endl;
    msg.notice(1) << "Some useful info" << endl;
    msg.notice(5) << "Info that nobody cares about, unless they are debugging" << endl;
    \endcode
    Calls to notice(N) with N > the notice level will return a null stream so that the output is not printed.

    Furthermore, a chosen header may be added to messages of each type. So that the screen output from the previous
    could be:
    \code
    error!!!!: Bad input
    warning!!: I hope you know what you are doing
    Some useful info
    notice(5): Info that nobody cares about, unless they are debugging
    \endcode

    Messenger is copyable. This enables use cases where one global Messegner (possibly even having an open file)
    is copied into a local class and local settings changes applied.

    \b Implemntation

     - Errors and warnings are always printed.
     - Notice messages are printed when n <= the notice level.
     - 1 Should be the minimum notice level actually used so that all noticed messages may be silenced by setting 0.
     - Streams for each level are stored separately as pointers and can be set.
     - Streams default to cerr for errors and warnings and cout for notice messages.
     - Arbitrary streams may be set - however, since they are stored by pointer the caller is responsible for
       deleting them when set in this manner.
     - An alternate interface openFile opens a file for overwrite for all output levels, owned by the Messenger.

    \b HOOMD specific

    One global Messenger will be initialized in python and passed to the ExecutionConfiguration. From there, all C++
    classes can print messages via commands like m_exec_conf->msg->notice(1) << "blah". Maybe a macro NOTICE() to 
    simplify the typing??? Need to debate that.

    The following notice levels will be used:
    - Error: Any condtition that is erroneous and will prevent the run from continuing
        - Generally followed by a thrown exception
    - Warning: Out of bounds parameters, settings that will use a lot of memory, etc... Things that won't prevent
      continued execution, but that may lead to incorrect behavior.
    - 1: typical status messages
        - python command echos
        - TPS reports
        - which hardware is active
    - 2: notifications of general interest that most people want to see
        - notices that certain hardware is unavailable
        - status information printed at the end of a run
    - 3,4: Additional details on top of 2.
    - 5-10: Varying debug messages, number chosen arbitrarily based on how often the message is likely to print
        - Some examples for consistency
        - 5 construction/desctruction messages from every major class
        - 6 memory allocation/reallocation notices from every major class
        - 7 memory allocation/reallocation notices from GPUArray
    - 10: Trace messages that may print many times per time step.
