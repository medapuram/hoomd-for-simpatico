//! Base type for time varying quantities
/*! Virtual base class for variables specified to vary over time. The base class provides
    a common interface for all subclass Variants.
     - A double value can be gotten from the Variant at any given time
     - An offset can be specified. A value set at time "t" in a variant will be returned
       at the actual time t+offset. The intended use for the offset is so that times
       can be specified as 0, 1000, 1e6 (or whatever) and be conveniently referenced
       with 0 being the current step.
