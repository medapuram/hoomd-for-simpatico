To build a Redhat Package Manager package (RPM) of a hoomd tagged release,
execute 'make rpm TAGVER=version'

To build an RPM of any other version,
execute 'make rpm VERSION=version RELEASE=release REFSPEC=refspec'
where version,release is the version and release number to include in the
rpm file name, and refspec is the git branch/tag to check out and build.

To build a Debian package (deb) of a release tag,
execute './deb_build_tag.sh tag'

To build a Mac OS X app bundle, configure cmake with the following options,
'-DENABLE_APP_BUNDLE_INSTALL=ON -DBOOST_ROOT=/opt/boost-ver/
-DBoost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS=ON -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python'
where /opt/boost-ver contains a build of boost linked against the system
installation of python. Then build the pacakge with 'make package'

Make sure the nvcc compiler from the cuda toolkit is in your path.

Note that you will need cmake, git, the rpm-build package (of
course), and some other software installed. Non-obvious missing software
should produce explicit error messages. If you have the software installed
but not as an rpm package, rpmbuild may still produce errors.
