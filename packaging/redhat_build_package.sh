# This script facilitates automatic nightly builds of RPM hoomd packages.
# To simply build a package, consider using 'make rpm' instead, or refer to
# the README or spec file for more information.
#
# To perform automatic package builds, this script should be invoked from cron
# with the following additions to crontab:
# MAILTO=''
# 0 0 * * * $HOME/hoomd-blue/packaging/redhat_build_package.sh >> $HOME/redhat_package_build.out 2>&1
#
# If this script is invoked automatically (as via crontab) from $HOME/hoomd-blue/packaging/
# then updates in hoomd-blue git will take two subsequent runs to take effect.
#
# Use the -f flag to prevent the script from performing an automatic update
# of itself and the Makefile.
