## \brief Get the version information of hoomd_script
# \returns a tuple (major, minor)
#
# This version is the version number of \b hoomd_script , not HOOMD as a whole. It is intended for use by
# third party API plugins that interface with hoomd_script. When new features are added (i.e. a new command
# or a new option to an existing command), the minor version will be incremented. When major changes are implemented
# or changes that break backwards compatibility are made, then the major version is incremented and the minor reset
# to 0. Only one such increment of either type will occur per each tagged release of HOOMD.

## \brief Runs the simulation for a given number of time steps
#
# \param tsteps Number of time steps to advance the simulation by
# \param profile Set to True to enable detailed profiling
# \param limit_hours  (if set) Limit the run to a given number of hours.
# \param limit_multiple Only allow the \a limit_hours setting to stop the simulation when the time step is a multiple of
#                       \a limit_multiple .
# \param callback     (if set) Sets a Python function to be called regularly during a run.
# \param callback_period Sets the period, in time steps, between calls made to \a callback
# \param quiet Set to True to eliminate the status information printed to the screen by the run
#
# \b Examples:
# \code
# run(1000)
# run(10e6)
# run(10000, profile=True)
# run(1e9, limit_hours=11)
#
# def py_cb(cur_tstep):
#     print "callback called at step: ", str(cur_tstep)
#
# run(10000, callback_period=100, callback=py_cb)
# \endcode
#
# Execute the run() command to advance the simulation forward in time. 
# During the run, all previously specified \ref analyze "analyzers", 
# \ref dump "dumps", \ref update "updaters" and the \ref integrate "integrators"
# are executed at the specified regular periods.
# 
# After run() completes, you may change parameters of the simulation (i.e. temperature)
# and continue the simulation by executing run() again. Time steps are added
# cumulatively, so calling run(1000) and then run(2000) would run the simulation
# up to time step 3000.
#
# run() cannot be executed before the system is \ref init "initialized". In most 
# cases, it also doesn't make sense to execute run() until after pair forces, bond forces,
# and an \ref integrate "integrator" have been created.
#
# When \a profile is \em True, a detailed breakdown of how much time was spent in each
# portion of the calculation is printed at the end of the run. Collecting this timing information
# can slow the simulation on the GPU significantly; so only enable profiling for testing
# and troubleshooting purposes.
#
# If \a limit_hours is changed from the default of None, the run will continue until either
# the specified number of time steps has been reached, or the given number of hours has
# elapsed. This option can be useful in shared machines where the queuing system limits
# job run times. A fractional value can be given to limit a run to only a few minutes,
# if needed.
#
# When running restartable jobs, it may be advantageous to enforce that run() ends on a time step that is a multiple
# of some value. For example, when dumping dcd trajectories with a period of 200,000 you may want to ensure that a job
# always ends on a multiple of 200,000 so that when the next run begins, dump.dcd can continue writing right where it
# left off instead of at some random time (e.g. 234,187) that just happened to be when the time limit was reached in
# the previous run. Set this multiple with the \a limit_multiple argument. Keep in mind that a large multiple may
# require a long buffer time between \a limit_hours and the job %wall clock limit as submitted to the queue.
#
# If \a callback is set to a Python function then this function will be called regularly
# at \a callback_period intervals. The callback function must receive one integer as argument
# and can return an integer. The argument is the current time step number,
# and if the callback function returns a negative number then the run is immediately aborted.
# All other return values are currently ignored.
#
# If \a callback_period is set to 0 (the default) then the callback is only called
# once at the end of the run. Otherwise the callback is executed whenever the current
# time step number is a multiple of \a callback_period.
