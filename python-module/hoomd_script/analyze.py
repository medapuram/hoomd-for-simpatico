## \package hoomd_script.analyze
# \brief Commands that %analyze the system and provide some output
#
# An analyzer examines the system state in some way every \a period time steps and generates
# some form of output based on the analysis. Check the documentation for individual analyzers 
# to see what they do.

## \page variable_period_docs Variable period specification
#
# If, for any reason, a constant period for a command is not to your liking, you can make it any 
# function you please! Just specify a function taking a single argument to the period parameter.
# Any analyze, update, or dump command in hoomd can be given such a variable period. 
# dump.xml is used as an example here, but the same works with \b any update, dump, 
# or analyze command
#
# For example, lets say we want to dump xml files at time steps 1, 10, 100, 1000, ...
# The following command will do the job.
#
# \code
# dump.xml(filename="dump", period = lambda n: 10**n)
# \endcode
#
# It is that simple. Any mathematical expression that can be represented in python can be used
# in place of the 10**n.
#
# <b>More examples:</b>
# \code
# dump.xml(filename="dump", period = lambda n: n**2)
# dump.xml(filename="dump", period = lambda n: 2**n)
# dump.xml(filename="dump", period = lambda n: 1005 + 0.5 * 10**n)
# \endcode
#
# The only requirement is that the object passed into period is callable, accepts one argument, and returns 
# a floating point number or integer. The function also had better be monotonically increasing or the output
# might not make any sense.
#
# <b>How does it work, exactly?</b>
# - First, the current time step of the simulation is saved when the analyzer is created
# - \a n is also set to 1 when the analyzer is created
# - Every time the analyzer performs it's output, it evaluates the given function at the current value of \a n
#   and records that as the next time to perform the analysis. \a n is then incremented by 1
#
# Here is a final example of how variable periods behave in simulations where analyzers are not created on time step 0.
# The following
# \code
# ... initialize ...
# run(4000)
# dump.xml(filename="dump", period = lambda n: 2**n)
# run(513)
# \endcode
# will result in dump files at time steps 4000, 4002, 4004, 4008, 4016, 4032, 4064, 4128, 4256, and 4512.
#
# In other words, the function specified for the period starts counting at the time step <b>when the analyzer is created</b>.
# Consequently, any analyze, dump, or update command given a variable period becomes ill-defined if it is disabled and then re-enabled.
# If this is done, it will then re-enable with a constant period of 1000 as a default case.

#   - **kinetic_energy** (in energy units)
#   - **temperature** (in thermal energy units)
#   - **pressure** (in pressure units)
#   - **pressure_xx**, **pressure_xy**, **pressure_xz**, **pressure_yy**, **pressure_yz**, **pressure_zz** (in pressure units)
# - The above quantities, tagged with a <i>_groupname</i> suffix are automatically available for any group passed to
#   an integrate command 
# - Specify a compute.thermo directly to enable additional quantities for user-specified groups.
#
# The following quantities are only available if the command is parentheses has been specified and is active
# for logging. 
# - Pair potentials
#   - **pair_dpd_energy** (pair.dpd) - Total DPD conservative potential energy (in energy units)
#   - **pair_dpdlj_energy** (pair.dpdlj) - Total DPDLJ conservative potential energy (in energy units)
#   - **pair_eam_energy** (pair.eam) - Total EAM potential energy (in energy units)

#   - **bond_harmonic_energy** (bond.harmonic) - Total harmonic bond potential energy (in energy units)

# 
# Additionally, the following commands can be provided user-defined names that are appended as suffixes to the 
# logged quantitiy (e.g. with \c pair.lj(r_cut=2.5, \c name="alpha"), the logged quantity would be pair_lj_energy_alpha).
# - All pair potentials
# - All bond potentials
#
# By specifying a force, disabling it with the \a log=True option, and then logging it, different energy terms can
# be computed while only a subset of them actually drive the simulation. Common use-cases of this capability
# include separating out pair energy of given types (shown below) and free energy calculations. Be aware that the
# globally chosen \a r_cut value is the largest of all active pair potentials and those with \a log=True, so you will
# observe performance degradation if you \a disable(log=True) a potential with a large \a r_cut.
#
# \b Examples:
# \code
# lj1 = pair.lj(r_cut=3.0, name="lj1")
# lj1.pair_coeff.set('A', 'A', epsilon=1.0, sigma=1.0)
# lj1.pair_coeff.set('A', 'B', epsilon=1.0, sigma=1.0)
# lj1.pair_coeff.set('B', 'B', epsilon=1.0, sigma=1.0)

## Calculates the mean-squared displacement of groups of particles and logs the values to a file
#
# analyze.msd can be given any number of groups of particles. Every \a period time steps, it calculates the mean squared 
# displacement of each group (referenced to the particle positions at the time step the command is issued at) and prints
# the calculated values out to a file.
# 
# The mean squared displacement (MSD) for each group is calculated as:
# \f[ \langle |\vec{r} - \vec{r}_0|^2 \rangle \f]
# and values are correspondingly written in units of distance squared.
#
# The file format is the same convenient delimited format used by analyze.log 
#
# analyze.msd is capable of appending to an existing msd file (the default setting) for use in restarting in long jobs.
# To generate a correct msd that does not reset to 0 at the start of each run, save the initial state of the system
# in a hoomd_xml file, including position and image data at a minimum. In the continuation job, specify this file
# in the \a r0_file argument to analyze.msd.
class msd(_analyzer):
    ## Initialize the msd calculator
    #
    # \param filename File to write the %data to
    # \param groups List of groups to calculate the MSDs of
    # \param period Quantities are logged every \a period time steps
    # \param header_prefix (optional) Specify a string to print before the header
    # \param r0_file hoomd_xml file specifying the positions (and images) to use for \f$ \vec{r}_0 \f$
    # \param overwrite set to True to overwrite the file \a filename if it exists
    #
    # \b Examples:
    # \code
    # msd = analyze.msd(filename='msd.log', groups=[group1, group2], 
    #                   period=100)

    # 
    # The \a header_prefix can be used in a number of ways. It specifies a simple string that
    # will be printed before the header line of the output file. One handy way to use this
    # is to specify header_prefix='#' so that \c gnuplot will ignore the header line
    # automatically. Another use-case would be to specify a descriptive line containing
    # details of the current run. Examples of each of these cases are given above.
    #
    # If \a r0_file is left at the default of None, then the current state of the system at the execution of the
    # analyze.msd command is used to initialize \f$ \vec{r}_0 \f$.
