## \package hoomd_script.charge
# \brief Commands that create forces between pairs of particles
#
# Charged interactions are usually long ranged, and for computational efficiency this is split
# into two parts, one part computed in real space and on in Fourier space. You don't need to worry about this
# implementation detail, however, as charge commands in hoomd automatically initialize and configure both the long
# and short range parts.
# 
# Only one method of computing charged interactions should be used at a time. Otherwise, they would add together and
# produce incorrect results.
#
# The following methods are available:
# - pppm

## Long-range electrostatics computed with the PPPM method
#
# Reference \cite LeBard2012 describes the PPPM implementation details in HOOMD-blue. Cite it
# if you utilize the PPPM functionality in your work.
#
# The command charge.pppm specifies that the \b both the long-ranged \b and short range parts of the electrostatic
# force is computed between all charged particles in the simulation. In other words, charge.pppm() initializes and
# sets all parameters for its own pair.ewald, so you do not need to specify an additional one.
#
# Parameters:
# - Nx - Number of grid points in x direction
# - Ny - Number of grid points in y direction
# - Nz - Number of grid points in z direction
# - order - Number of grid points in each direction to assign charges to
# - \f$ r_{\mathrm{cut}} \f$ - Cutoff for the short-ranged part of the electrostatics calculation
#
# Parameters Nx, Ny, Nz, order, \f$ r_{\mathrm{cut}} \f$ must be set using
# set_params() before any run() can take place.
#
# See \ref page_units for information on the units assigned to charges in hoomd.
# \note charge.pppm takes a particle group as an option. This should be the group of all charged particles
#       (group.charged). However, note that this group is static and determined at the time charge.pppm() is specified.
#       If you are going to add charged particles at a later point in the simulation with the data access API,
#       ensure that this group includes those particles as well.
