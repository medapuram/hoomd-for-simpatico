## \package hoomd_script.dihedral
# \brief Commands that specify %dihedral forces
#
# Dihedrals add forces between specified quadruplets of particles and are typically used to 
# model rotation about chemical bonds. Dihedrals between particles are set when an input XML file is read
# (init.read_xml) or when an another initializer creates them (like init.create_random_polymers)
#
# By themselves, dihedrals that have been specified in an input file do nothing. Only when you 
# specify an dihedral force (i.e. dihedral.harmonic), are forces actually calculated between the 
# listed particles.

## Harmonic %dihedral force
#
# The command dihedral.harmonic specifies a %harmonic dihedral potential energy between every defined 
# quadruplet of particles in the simulation. 
# \f[ V(r) = \frac{1}{2}k \left( 1 + d \cos\left(n * \phi(r) \right) \right) \f]
# where \f$ \phi \f$ is angle between two sides of the dihedral
#
# Coefficients:
# - \f$ k \f$ - strength of %force (in energy units)
# - \f$ d \f$ - sign factor (unitless)
# - \f$ n \f$ - angle scaling factor (unitless)
#
# Coefficients \f$ k \f$, \f$ d \f$, \f$ n \f$ and  must be set for each type of %dihedral in the simulation using
# set_coeff().
#
# \note Specifying the dihedral.harmonic command when no dihedrals are defined in the simulation results in an error.
