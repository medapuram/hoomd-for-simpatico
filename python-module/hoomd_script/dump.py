    # \param file1 (optional) First alternating file name to write
    # \param file2 (optional) Second alternating file name to write
    # \param compress Set to False to disable gzip compression
    # 
    # \b Examples:
    # \code
    # dump.bin(file1="restart.1.bin.gz", file2="restart.2.bin.gz", period=1e5)
    # dump.bin(filename="particles", period=1000)

    # bin = dump.bin()
    # \endcode
    #
    # If period is set, a new file will be created every \a period steps. The time step at which 
    # the file is created is added to the file name in a fixed width format to allow files to easily 
    # be read in order. I.e. the write at time step 0 with \c filename="particles" produces the file 
    # \c particles.0000000000.bin (.gz if \a compress = True)
    #
    # If \a compress is True (the default), output will be gzip compressed for a significant savings. init.read_bin()
    # will auto-detect whether or not the %data needs to be decompressed by the ".gz" file extension.
    #
    # If \a file1 and \a file2 are specified, then the output is written every \a period time steps alternating
    # between those two files. This use-case is useful when only the most recent state of the system is needed
    # to continue a job. The alternation between two files is so that if the job ends or crashes while writing one of
    # of the files, the other is still available for use. Make sure to include a .gz file extension if compression
    # is enabled.
    #
    # Binary files include the \b entire state of the system, including the time step, particle positions,
    # velocities, et cetera, and the internal state variables of any relevant integration methods. All %data is saved
    # exactly as it appears in memory so that loading the %data with init.read_bin is as close as possible as one
    # can get to exactly restarting the simulation as if it has never stopped. Restarts that continue 100%
    # \b exactly, bit for bit, as they would have if they had never stopped are possible under certain circumstances.
    #
    # For the integration state information to be read and properly associated with the correct integrator, there must
    # be the same number of integrator modes and methods <b>and in the same order</b> in the continuation script as are
    # in the initial job script. One way to ensure this is to copy the initial script and comment out all of the run()
    # commands up until the point that the restart file was written. Another method is to utilize run_upto() in your
    # job script.
    #
    # If \a period is not specified, then no periodic updates will occur. Instead, the file
    # \a filename is written immediately.
    #
    # \note The binary file format may change from one hoomd release to the next. Efforts will be made so that
    # newer versions of hoomd can read previous version's binary format, but support is not guaranteed. The intended
    # use case for dump.bin() is for saving data to restart and/or continue jobs that fail or reach a %wall clock time
    # limit. If you need to store data in a system and version independent manner, use dump.xml().
