# \brief Commands that create external forces on particles

# Apply an %external force to all particles in the simulation. This module organizes all external forces.
# As an example, a force derived from a %periodic potential can be used to induce a concentration modulation
# in the system.

# \brief Defines external potential coefficients
# The coefficients for all %external force are specified using this class. Coefficients are specified per-particle
# type.
#
# There are two ways to set the coefficients for a particular %external %force.
# The first way is to save the %external %force in a variable and call set() directly.
# To see an example of this, see the documentation for the package.
#
# The second method is to build the coeff class first and then assign it to the
# %external %force. There are some advantages to this method in that you could specify a
# complicated set of %external %force coefficients in a separate python file and import it into
# your job script.
#
# Example:
# \code
# my_coeffs = external.coeff();
# my_external_force.force_coeff.set('A', A=1.0, i=1, w=0.02, p=3)
# my_external_force.force_coeff.set('B', A=-1.0, i=1, w=0.02, p=3)
# \endcode

    ## Sets parameters for one particle type
    # \param type Type of particle
    # \param coeff Named coefficients (see below for examples)
    #
    # Calling set() results in one or more parameters being set for a particle type. Types are identified
    # by name, and parameters are also added by name. Which parameters you need to specify depends on the %external
    # %force you are setting these coefficients for, see the corresponding documentation.
    #
    # All possible particle types as defined in the simulation box must be specified before executing run().
    # You will receive an error if you fail to do so. It is not an error, however, to specify coefficients for
    # particle types that do not exist in the simulation. This can be useful in defining a %force field for many
    # different types of particles even when some simulations only include a subset.
    #
    # To set the same coefficients between many particle types, provide a list of type names instead of a single
    # one. All types in the list will be set to the same parameters. A convenient wildcard that lists all types
    # of particles in the simulation can be gotten from a saved \c system from the init command.
    #
    # \b Examples:
    # \code
    # coeff.set('A', A=1.0, i=1, w=0.02, p=3)
    # coeff.set('B', A=-1.0, i=1, w=0.02, p=3)
    # coeff.set(['A','B'], i=1, w=0.02, p=3)
    # \endcode
    #
    # \note Single parameters can be updated. If both epsilon and sigma have already been set for a particle type,
    # then executing coeff.set('A', A =1.0) will %update the value of A and leave the other parameters as they
    # were previously set.

## One-dimension periodic potential
#
# The command %periodic specifies that an external %force should be
# added to every particle in the simulation to induce a periodic modulation
# in the particle concentration. The force parameters can be set on a per-particle
# type-basis. The potential can e.g. be used to induce an ordered phase in a block-copolymer melt.
#
# The external potential \f$V(\vec{r}) \f$ is implemented using the following formula:
#
#    \f[
#    V(\vec{r}) = A * \tanh\left[\frac{1}{2 \pi p w} \cos\left(p \vec{b}_i\cdot\vec{r}\right)\right]
#    \f]
#
#    where \f$A\f$ is the ordering parameter, \f$\vec{b}_i\f$ is the reciprocal lattice vector direction
#    \f$i=0..2\f$, \f$p\f$ the periodicity and \f$w\f$ the interface width
#    (relative to the distance \f$2\pi/|\mathbf{b_i}|\f$ between planes in the \f$i\f$-direction).
#    The modulation is one-dimensional. It extends along the lattice vector \f$\mathbf{a}_i\f$ of the
#    simulation cell.
