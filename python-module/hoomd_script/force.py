#
# A force in hoomd_script reflects a ForceCompute in c++. It is responsible
# for all high-level management that happens behind the scenes for hoomd_script
# writers. 1) The instance of the c++ analyzer itself is tracked and added to the
# System 2) methods are provided for disabling the force from being added to the
# net force on each particle

    ## Disables the force
    # \param log Set to True if you plan to continue logging the potential energy associated with this force.
    #
    # \b Examples:
    # \code
    # force.disable()
    # force.disable(log=True)
    # \endcode
    #
    # Executing the disable command will remove the force from the simulation.
    # Any run() command executed after disabling a force will not calculate or 
    # use the force during the simulation. A disabled force can be re-enabled
    # with enable()
    #
    # By setting \a log to True, the values of the force can be logged even though the forces are not applied 
    # in the simulation.  For forces that use cutoff radii, setting \a log=True will cause the correct r_cut values 
    # to be used throughout the simulation, and therefore possibly drive the neighbor list size larger than it
    # otherwise would be. If \a log is left False, the potential energy associated with this force will not be
    # available for logging.
    #
    # To use this command, you must have saved the force in a variable, as 
    # shown in this example:
    # \code
    # force = pair.some_force()
    # # ... later in the script
    # force.disable()
    # force.disable(log=True)
    # \endcode
    def disable(self, log=False):
        util.print_status_line();
        self.check_initialization();
            
        # check if we are already disabled
        if not self.enabled:
            globals.msg.warning("Ignoring command to disable a force that is already disabled");
            return;
        
        self.enabled = False;
        self.log = log;
        
        # remove the compute from the system if it is not going to be logged
        if not log:
            globals.system.removeCompute(self.force_name);

    ## Benchmarks the force computation
    # \param n Number of iterations to average the benchmark over
    #
    # \b Examples:
    # \code
    # t = force.benchmark(n = 100)
    # \endcode
    #
    # The value returned by benchmark() is the average time to perform the force 
    # computation, in milliseconds. The benchmark is performed by taking the current
    # positions of all particles in the simulation and repeatedly calculating the forces
    # on them. Thus, you can benchmark different situations as you need to by simply 
    # running a simulation to achieve the desired state before running benchmark().
    #
    # \note
    # There is, however, one subtle side effect. If the benchmark() command is run 
    # directly after the particle data is initialized with an init command, then the 
    # results of the benchmark will not be typical of the time needed during the actual
    # simulation. Particles are not reordered to improve cache performance until at least
    # one time step is performed. Executing run(1) before the benchmark will solve this problem.
    #
    # To use this command, you must have saved the force in a variable, as
    # shown in this example:
    # \code
    # force = pair.some_force()
    # # ... later in the script
    # t = force.benchmark(n = 100)
    # \endcode

        self.check_initialization();
