## \package hoomd_script.improper
# \brief Commands that specify %improper forces
#
# Impropers add forces between specified quadruplets of particles and are typically used to 
# model rotation about chemical bonds without having bonds to connect the atoms. Their most
# common use is to keep structural elements flat, i.e. model the effect of conjugated
# double bonds, like in benzene rings and its derivatives.
# Impropers between particles are set when an input XML file is read
# (init.read_xml) or when an another initializer creates them (like init.create_random_polymers)
#
# By themselves, impropers that have been specified in an input file do nothing. Only when you 
# specify an improper force (i.e. improper.harmonic), are forces actually calculated between the 
# listed particles.

## Harmonic %improper force
#
# The command improper.harmonic specifies a %harmonic improper potential energy between every quadruplet of particles
# in the simulation. 
# \f[ V(r) = \frac{1}{2}k \left( \chi - \chi_{0}  \right )^2 \f]
# where \f$ \chi \f$ is angle between two sides of the improper
#
# Coefficients:
# - \f$ k \f$ - strength of %force (in energy units)
# - \f$ \chi_{0} \f$ - equilibrium angle (in radians)
#
# Coefficients \f$ k \f$ and \f$ \chi_0 \f$ must be set for each type of %improper in the simulation using
# set_coeff().
#
# \note Specifying the improper.harmonic command when no impropers are defined in the simulation results in an error.
