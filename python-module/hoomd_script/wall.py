## \package hoomd_script.wall
# \brief Commands that specify %wall forces
#
# Walls can add forces to any particles within a certain distance of the wall. Walls are created
# when an input XML file is read (read.xml).
#
# By themselves, walls that have been specified in an input file do nothing. Only when you 
# specify a wall force (i.e. wall.lj), are forces actually applied between the wall and the
# particle.

## Lennard-Jones %wall %force
#
# The command wall.lj specifies that a Lennard-Jones type %wall %force should be added to every
# particle in the simulation.
#
# The %force \f$ \vec{F}\f$ is
# \f{eqnarray*}
#    \vec{F}  = & -\nabla V(r) & r < r_{\mathrm{cut}} \\
#             = & 0            & r \ge r_{\mathrm{cut}} \\
# \f}
# where
# \f[ V(r) = 4 \varepsilon \left[ \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{12} - 
#                                        \alpha \left( \frac{\sigma}{r} \right)^{6} \right] \f]
# and \f$ \vec{r} \f$ is the vector pointing from the %wall to the particle parallel to the wall's normal.
#
# The following coefficients must be set for each particle type using set_coeff(). 
# - \f$ \varepsilon \f$ - \c epsilon (in energy units)
# - \f$ \sigma \f$ - \c sigma (in distance units)
# - \f$ \alpha \f$ - \c alpha (unitless)
#
# \b Example:
# \code
# lj.set_coeff('A', epsilon=1.0, sigma=1.0, alpha=1.0)
# \endcode
#
# This interaction is applied between every particle and every wall defined in the simulation box. Walls are specified
# specified in file given to init.read_xml(). See the page \ref page_xml_file_format for information on creating walls,
# specifically the section \ref sec_xml_wall.
#
# The cutoff radius \f$ r_{\mathrm{cut}} \f$ is set once when wall.lj is specified (see __init__())
class lj(force._force):
    ## Specify the Lennard-Jones %wall %force

    # \code

    #
    # \note Coefficients must be set with set_coeff() before the simulation can be run().

    ## Sets the particle-wall interaction coefficients for a particular particle type
    #
    # \param particle_type Particle type to set coefficients for
    # \param epsilon Coefficient \f$ \varepsilon \f$ in the %force (in energy units)
    # \param sigma Coefficient \f$ \sigma \f$ in the %force (in distance units)
    # \param alpha Coefficient \f$ \alpha \f$ in the %force (unitless)

    # \code
    # lj_wall = wall.lj(r_cut=3.0)

    # lj_wall.set_coeff('B', epsilon=1.0, sigma=2.0, alpha=0.0)
