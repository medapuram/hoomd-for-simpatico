/*! \file boost_utf_configure.h
    \brief Helps unit tests setup the boost unit testing framework
    \details boost, for whatever reason, has greatly changed the interface
        for the unit testing framework over the versions. This header file
        does it's best to setup BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE( ) to work for
        any version of boost from 1.32 to 1.34 ... hopefully not much
        changes in 1.35
    \note This file should be included only once and by a file that will
        compile into a unit test executable
*/

// unit testing has changed much over the different boost versions: try to
// handle all the way back to 1.32 (included RHEL4 based installs which are still quite common
// these days)

// setup is tested and works on:
// boost 1.36.0 (Mac OS X)
// boost 1.35.1 (gentoo)
// boost 1.34.1 (gentoo)
// boost 1.33.1 (fedora 7)
// boost 1.32.0 (RHEL4)
// it may work on other versions or it may need tweaking
